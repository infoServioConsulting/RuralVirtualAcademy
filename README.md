# Apex Classes for the Valence Salesforce Integration App

Above are the classes developed by James Pier @ Servio Consulting for the Rural Virtual Academy integration. This connected Salesforce to two separate external systems via the Skyward and Google Sheets APIs. 

There may be additional setup required in Salesforce to facilitate this code. This is used for example purposes only and the RVA Salesforce orgs should be referenced for the complete build details.
